# ðŸ”— `devnet-1`

The main development network, intended primarily for use by the OKP4 core team. This `devnet` functions as a "playground" for those looking to experiment with the protocol as a blockchain user, token holder, application developer or network validator.

This network is very unstable, and the whole blockchain can be reset, deleting all blocks.
